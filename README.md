Optimally, use pyenv for Python version management, to avoid messy interchange Python version. You can u pip if u want but not suggested, the dependencies are in .toml file

## Steps to start up project


1. `pyenv install 3.7.10` - to tell pyenv to download python 3.7.10 binary

2. `pyenv local 3.7.10` - to tell pyenv to use only 3.7.10 in this directory


Poetry for dependency management, sort of like npm default behavior, where package version is localized based on the directory path, instead of globally.

Then, use poetry

1. `poetry env use python` - tell poetry to use local directory python version
2. `poetry install` - install all dependencies in .toml file
3. `cd src` and run backend flask app with poetry  `poetry run flask run`

In VS Code, change the Python interpreter to something generated by poetry virtual env. Starting with `'/Library/caches/.../blabla-py3.7'`

## .env file is needed to connect to Postgresql database.
